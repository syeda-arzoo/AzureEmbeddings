"Please create a realistic, detailed service agreement contract between two parties, 'ABC Corp' and 'XYZ Solutions.' The contract should include specific clause titles, such as 'Payment Terms,' 'Termination,' 'Confidentiality,' 'Liability,' and 'Intellectual Property Rights,' among others. Each clause should use realistic names, values, and dates instead of placeholders. For example:

Names like 'ABC Corp' and 'XYZ Solutions' should appear in relevant sections.
Include specific payment amounts (e.g., ' 10,000′)𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑠(𝑒.𝑔.,′𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ𝑙𝑦𝑝𝑎𝑦𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠𝑑𝑢𝑒𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ𝑒1𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑓𝑒𝑎𝑐ℎ𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ′).−𝑈𝑠𝑒𝑒𝑥𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑑(𝑒.𝑔.,′𝐽𝑎𝑛𝑢𝑎𝑟𝑦1,2024′𝑡𝑜′𝐷𝑒𝑐𝑒𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟31,2024′).−𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑣𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟𝑠,𝑙𝑖𝑘𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑓𝑒𝑒𝑠,𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑠(𝑒.𝑔.,′1.5 100,000').
