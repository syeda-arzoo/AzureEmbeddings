            "[\"Company A Contract Document\\nContract Title: Supplier Agreement\\nThis Agreement is made and entered into as of [Date], by and between:\\nSupplier Name: [Supplier A]\\nBuyer Name: [Buyer A]\\nContract Duration: [Start Date] to [End Date]\\n1. Rebates/Volume Discounts\\nThe Supplier agrees to provide volume-based discounts to the Buyer, incentivizing higher\\npurchase volumes with proportional rebates. For each calendar quarter, the Supplier will\\nassess the total purchase volume made by the Buyer and apply tiered discounts once certain\\nthresholds are met. Volume thresholds and their associated rebate percentages are detailed\\nin Appendix A of this contract. Should the Buyer's purchases meet or exceed a specified\\nthreshold within the quarter, a corresponding rebate will be issued in the form of a credit\\nnote, applied to the following quarter's orders.\\nIf the Buyer reaches multiple thresholds within the same quarter, the Supplier will apply the\\nhighest qualifying rebate for that period. The Buyer is eligible to apply the credit note within\\nsix months of issuance, and unused credits beyond this period will be forfeited. Rebates do\\nnot apply to items returned or otherwise refunded, and only net purchase volumes (after\\nreturns or adjustments) will be eligible for rebate calculations. Both parties agree that\\nadjustments to the rebate structure can be negotiated annually to reflect changing demand\\nand market conditions.\\n2. SLAs/Service Credits\\nThe Supplier commits to maintaining a minimum service level, as outlined in the Service\\nLevel Agreement (SLA) Schedule of this contract. This includes an uptime percentage of no\\nless than 99.5% monthly. In the event of any service interruptions or downtimes exceeding\\nthe allowable limit, the Supplier will provide service credits to the Buyer based on the\\nduration and impact of the downtime.\\nService credits will be calculated as a percentage of the monthly service fee, with specific\\npercentages detailed in the SLA Schedule. Credits will be applied to the Buyer's next billing\\ncycle. If the Supplier fails to meet the SLA for three consecutive months, the Buyer reserves\\nthe right to review the agreement and, if necessary, terminate the contract without penalty.\\nBoth parties agree that the Supplier will proactively report service performance at the end\\nof each month, providing transparency and accountability.\\n3. Price Protection\\nThe prices set forth in this agreement shall remain fixed for the initial 12 months.\\nThereafter, pricing will be subject to an annual review based on market indices for\\ncomparable goods and services, as determined by a mutually agreed-upon benchmark. Any\\nprice adjustment shall be limited to a maximum increase of 3% per annum unless both\\nparties agree otherwise.\\nIn the event of significant market fluctuations, the Buyer reserves the right to request a\\nformal pricing review, ensuring continued competitive rates. If the Supplier proposes any\\nprice increase exceeding the agreed limit, the Buyer may request a detailed breakdown of\\nthe cost factors justifying the increase. Both parties agree to meet and negotiate in good\\nfaith to resolve any pricing disputes, with the goal of maintaining a fair and stable pricing\\nstructure throughout the contract term.\\n4. Forex\\nThe exchange rate applied to payments under this contract shall be locked at the rate in\\neffect at the time of signing for the first 12 months. An annual review will allow both parties\\nto adjust the rate based on the prevailing market conditions, using the average rate from a\\ntrusted financial institution as a reference.\\nIf the exchange rate fluctuates by more than 5% during the review period, an adjustment\\nwill be applied to reflect this change. This exchange rate lock minimizes currency risk for\\nboth parties and ensures predictable pricing adjustments on an annual basis.\\n5. COLA/Inflation Adjustment\\nThe contract pricing will be reviewed and adjusted annually based on the national\\nConsumer Price Index (CPI). A price increase or decrease will be applied proportionally to\\nreflect changes in the CPI over the previous year, with adjustments capped at 5% per year to\\nprevent significant fluctuations.\\nBoth parties agree to a yearly review meeting to discuss any economic changes that may\\nimpact contract pricing. This adjustment ensures fair alignment with inflation trends while\\ncapping excessive price changes.\\n6. Payment Terms\\nThe Buyer agrees to settle all invoices within 30 days of receipt. Payments will be made via\\nbank transfer to the Supplier's designated account. In exchange for early payment, the\\nSupplier offers a 2% discount if the invoice is paid within 10 days.\\nThis clause incentivizes the Buyer to make early payments while offering a standard 30-day\\npayment period. The early payment discount supports the Supplier's cash flow while\\nproviding savings for the Buyer.\\n7. Early Payment Discounts\\nThe Buyer is entitled to a 2% discount on the total invoice amount if full payment is made\\nwithin 10 days from the invoice issuance date. This discount will apply only to invoices paid\\nvia direct bank transfer and does not apply to partial payments.\\nThis clause encourages the Buyer to settle invoices promptly, improving cash flow for the\\nSupplier. The direct bank transfer requirement ensures lower processing fees and quicker\\nfund availability.\\n8. Late Payment Penalties\\nThe Buyer agrees that any invoice not paid within 30 days of the invoice date will incur a\\npenalty of 1.5% interest per month on the outstanding balance. The penalty will be applied\\nmonthly until the total balance is settled. The Supplier reserves the right to suspend services\\nif payments are more than 60 days overdue.\\nThis penalty structure deters late payments by adding a significant financial consequence\\nthat compounds monthly, while also providing the Supplier with the option to suspend\\nservices if the issue persists.\\n9. Termination Provisions\\nEither party may terminate this Agreement for convenience, without penalty, by providing a\\nwritten notice at least 60 days prior to the intended termination date. During this notice\\nperiod, both parties agree to fulfill all existing obligations, including any outstanding orders\\nand payment commitments. Termination under this clause does not affect any accrued\\nrights or obligations prior to the termination date.\\nThis variation allows flexibility by giving both parties a clear and reasonable timeline for\\nending the contract if business circumstances change, without fault or penalty.\\n10. Committal/Non-Committal Contracts\\nThis Agreement is non-committal, meaning that neither party is obligated to purchase or sell\\nany specific quantity of goods or services. The agreement serves as a framework for future\\nnegotiations but does not impose any binding commitment to enter into specific\\ntransactions. Either party may choose to enter into individual purchase orders under the\\nterms set forth in this Agreement, but there is no minimum purchase requirement.
